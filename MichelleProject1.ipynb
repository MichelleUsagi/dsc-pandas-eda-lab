    "In this section, you've learned a lot about importing, cleaning up, analyzing (using descriptive statistics) and visualizing data. In this cumulative lab, you'll get a chance to practice all of these skills with the Ames Housing dataset, which contains information about home sales in Ames, Iowa between 2006 and 2010.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Practice loading data with pandas\n",
    "* Practice calculating measures of centrality and dispersion with pandas\n",
    "* Practice creating subsets of data with pandas\n",

    "#### 1. Load the Dataset with Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Import pandas with the standard alias `pd` and load the data into a dataframe with the standard name `df`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Explore Data Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "Produce summary statistics, visualizations, and interpretive text describing the distributions of `SalePrice`, `TotRmsAbvGrd`, and `OverallCond`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Explore Differences between Subsets\n",
    "\n",
    "Separate the data into subsets based on `OverallCond`, then demonstrate how this split impacts the distribution of `SalePrice`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Explore Correlations\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the features that have the strongest positive and negative correlations with `SalePrice`, and produce plots representing these relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Engineer and Explore a New Feature\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a new feature `Age`, which represents the difference between the year sold and the year built, and plot the relationship between the age and sale price."

    "# House Sale Price Histogram\n",
    "The Histogrm displays the distribution of the variable 'SalePrice' on axis X ,which represents the  selling prices of houses, and count on the Y axis which represents the number of houses sold at that price range.\n",
    "## Observations\n",
    "The distribution is right-skewed which means more houses are sold at a lower price compared to those sold at high price.\n",
    "## Interpretation\n",
    "### Summary statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The mean is higher than the median which is usual for a right skewed disribution. This indicates that there are some high priced houses that are pulling the mean upwards.\n",
    "2. The standard variation is relatively high indicating variability in the sale prices of the houses.\n",
    "3. The histogram shows a peak between $100000 - $200000 meaning this is the most frequent price range for houses in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real Estate Market in Ames, Iowa between 2006 and 2010\n",
    "- The concentration of house price in the lower range suggests that most houses in the data set are affordable for the majority\n",
    "-  The right tail reflects the presence of a smaller segment of hihg-value homes\n",
    "- Market insight- Thiss distribution could indicate a market where affordable houising dominates with few luxury properties available\n",

    "# Total Rooms Above Grade Histogram\n",
    "The Histogrm displays the distribution of the variable 'TotRmsAbvGrd' on axis X ,which represents the total number of rooms above grade (excluding bathrooms), and count on the Y axis which represents the number of houses that fall into each range. \n",
    "## Observations\n",
    "- The distribution is skewed to the right, meaning there are more houses with a smaller number of rooms i.e 4–8 rooms, and fewer houses with a large number of rooms i.e 10–14 rooms.\n",
    "- Most houses have between 5 and 7 rooms\n",
    "## Interpretation\n",
    "### Summary statistics\n",
    " The combination of the right-skewed distribution, the mean, and the standard deviation suggests that:\n",
    "- Most of the houses have a relatively small number of rooms above grade.\n",
    "- There are some houses with a significantly larger number of rooms, which are pulling the mean towards the right.\n",

    "# Overall Condition Of House Histogram\n",
    "The Histogrm displays the distribution of the variable OverallCond on axis X ,which represents the overall condition of the house, and count on the Y axis which represents the number of houses that fall into each range.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Obseravations\n",
    "The distribution appears to be slightly left-skewed, as most values are concentrated around the condition rating of 5 and above\n",
    "## Summary Statistics\n",
    "- The average overall condition is slightly above 5, indicating that houses tend to lean slightly toward better-than-average condition.\n",
    "- The median condition is exactly 5, meaning 50% of houses have a condition rating below or equal to 5, while the other 50% are above.\n",
    "- The mean being slightly higher than the median reflects a minor influence of better-condition houses pulling the average upward.\n",
    "- A small standard deviation suggests that the ratings are tightly clustered around the mean and median.\n",
    "- The histogram has a clear peak at a condition rating of 5, indicating that \"average condition\" is the most common rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interpretation:\n",
    "- Most houses in this dataset are in average condition (5) or slightly above.\n",
    "- Houses in poor (1-3) or excellent (8-9) condition are rare, indicating the market is dominated by homes with mid-range condition ratings.\n",
    "- For buyers or sellers, this suggests that most houses require only moderate maintenance or repairs, with relatively few homes in exceptionally bad or excellent states.\n",

    "\n",
    "One useful way to explore a categorical variable is to create subsets of the full dataset based on that categorical variable, then plot their distributions based on some other variable.

    "## Key Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Positive Correlation\n",
    "There is a clear positive correlation between overall condition and sale price. Houses with above-average condition generally have higher sale prices compared to those with average or below-average condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distribution Shift\n",
    "As the overall condition improves, the distribution of sale prices shifts towards higher values. Houses with above-average condition tend to have a higher proportion of sales at higher price points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overlapping Distributions\n",
    "While there is a general trend of higher prices with better condition, the distributions overlap. This means that there are houses with below-average condition that have higher sale prices than some houses with average or even above-average condition. This suggests that other factors besides overall condition significantly influence sale price.\n",
    "There's existence of High-Priced Houses in Below-Average Condition.This could be due to factors like location that may outweigh the impact of the lower overall condition.\n",

    "# Correlation Between Overall Quality (OverallQual) and Sale Price\n",
    "## Interpretation:\n",
    "The OverallQual variable represents the overall material and finish quality of a house, rated on a scale i.e 1–10.\n",
    "The boxplot shows that as OverallQual increases, the sale price also increases significantly.\n",
    "Houses with higher quality i.e OverallQual = 10, have substantially higher sale prices.\n",
    "Conversely, houses with lower quality i.e OverallQual ≤ 3, have significantly lower sale prices and smaller variability.\n",
    "## Conclusion:\n",
    "There is a positive correlation between OverallQual and sale price. High-quality materials and finishes tend to drive up the value of homes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#  Correlation Between Kitchens Above Grade (KitchenAbvGr) and Sale Price\n",
    "## Interpretation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The KitchenAbvGr variable represents the number of kitchens above ground level in a house.\n",
    "The boxplot suggests most houses have 1 kitchen with a wide range of sale prices. The median price for houses with 1 kitchen is higher than those with 2 or 3 kitchens.\n",
    "Houses with 2 kitchens have lower sale prices than those with 1 kitchen, with less variability.\n",
    "Houses with 3 kitchens are rare and tend to have even lower sale prices, possibly due to them being less typical or having other factors affecting value.\n",
    "## Conclusion:\n",
    "There is no clear positive correlation between KitchenAbvGr and sale price. Having more than one kitchen does not necessarily increase a house’s value.\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "OverallQual is a strong driver of sale price and positively influences property value.\n",
    "KitchenAbvGr may not be a good predictor of sale price, and additional context i.e house size, target\n",
    "market may be needed to understand its impact fully.\n"

    "# SCATTER PLOT\n",
    "This scatter plot displays the relationship between the age of a home at the time of sale (x-axis) and its sale price (y-axis). The points represent individual homes, with their positions showing the corresponding age and price.\n",
    " ## Overall Trend:\n",
    "Newer homes (age near 0) tend to have higher sale prices, as evidenced by the denser cluster of points at the left side with sale prices around 200,000–400,000.\n",
    "As the age of the home increases, the sale price generally decreases, though the relationship weakens for very old homes.\n",
    "## Price Variation:\n",
    "Among newer homes, there is a wide range of sale prices. Some homes are sold at high prices (above 400,000), while others are sold for less.\n",
    "For older homes i.e age > 50, sale prices are lower on average, and the range of variation narrows, with most prices below 200,000.\n",
    "##  Conclusion\n",
    "Newer homes tend to sell for more, but home age alone does not completely explain the sale price. Other factors, like location or size may play a significant role.\n"

    "## Summary\n",
    "This dataset provides insights into the factors influencing home sale prices. It includes a variety of features that describe the properties, such as their physical characteristics, location, and overall quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the analysis, it’s clear that certain features have a stronger relationship with sale price than others. For example, homes with higher Overall Quality scores tend to sell for significantly more, highlighting the importance of craftsmanship and material quality. Similarly, features like the number of kitchens above grade (KitchenAbvGr) show specific but less impactful correlations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between a home’s age and its sale price is also notable. Newer homes tend to fetch higher prices, while older homes are generally less expensive. However, some older properties retain high values, likely due to renovations or historical significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the dataset emphasizes how a mix of structural quality, functionality, and perhaps some aesthetic or location-based factors combine to determine a home’s market value. While clear patterns exist, outliers and exceptions suggest that individual property details also play a crucial role in determining sale prices.\n"
